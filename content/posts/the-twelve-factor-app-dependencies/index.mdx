### Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

---

Most programming languages have their designated platforms for sharing and
posting system packages. For instance, Ruby utilizes `Rubygems`.

Each library can be installed through what we refer to as "site packages,"
which serve system-wide, or by explicitly declaring them within our app's scope,
a practice known as "vendoring."

**The Twelve-Factor methodology does not rely on the implicit existence of
system-wide packages.** Instead, dependencies should be declared within our 
application via a declaration manifest. Additionally, it employs dependency
isolation tools during execution to prevent any implicit dependencies from
seeping in from the surrounding system. For instance, Ruby employs the
`Gemfile` manifest format for dependency declaration and `bundle exec`
for dependency isolation.

Explicitly declaring dependencies brings the benefit of simplifying setup for
new developers joining the app. A new developer can clone the app's codebase
onto their local machine, needing only the language runtime and the installed
dependency manager as prerequisites. Consequently, they can set up everything
required with a single command, such as `bundle install` for Ruby/Bundler.

**The Twelve-Factor methodology also does not rely on the implicit existence of
system tools** like `curl` or `ImageMagick`, for example. Even though these tools
may be prevalent in many systems, there's no assurance that they will exist on
all systems where the app may run in the future, or that they will be compatible
with the app. All of those should be "vendored" into the app.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate the knowledge
I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
