### Treat logs as event streams

---

Logs offer insights into the behavior of a running app, typically stored in log
files on the disk containing the app's outputs.

They represent an aggregated, time-ordered stream of events occurring across
running processes and backing services, registering each event on a single line.
Logs flow continuously without a fixed start or end as long as the app operates.

**A twelve-factor app doesn't concern itself with routing or storing its output
stream.** Rather than managing log files, the focus is on directing processes
and backing services to output logs to `stdout`.

During local development, developers can observe logs in their terminal's
foreground to monitor the app's behavior. In other environments like `test`,
`staging`, or `production`, this is captured by the execution environment. All
streams from the app, its processes, and backing services are directed to one or
more final destinations for viewing and long-term storage, entirely managed by
the execution environment.

The app's event stream can be directed to a file or monitored in real-time
using terminal-based tail commands. Importantly, it can also be sent to a log
indexing and analysis system or a general-purpose data warehousing system like
`Hadoop` or `Hive`. These systems offer significant power and flexibility for
examining an app's behavior over time, including:

- Find specific time events in the past;
- Large-scale graphing of trends(such as the requests per minute);
- Active alerting according to user-defined heuristics(such as an alert when the
quantity of errors per minute exceeds a certain threshold)

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
