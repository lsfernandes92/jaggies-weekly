### Strictly separate build and run stages

---

A codebase goes through several stages before transforming into an execution
environment:

- The **build stage** involves a process that converts the code repository into
an executable bundle, known as the build. This stage, utilizing a root commit
specified by the deployment process, retrieves vendor dependencies and compiles
binaries and assets.
- The **release stage** takes the output produced by the build stage and
combines it with the deployment's configurations. The result of this combination
creates a package ready for immediate execution within the execution environment.
- The **run stage** (also referred to as "runtime") executes the app within the
execution environment by launching a set of the appâ€™s processes against a chosen
release.

**The Twelve-Factor app strictly emphasizes the separation between the build,
release, and run stages.** For instance, making changes to the code at runtime
is impossible, as there's no mechanism to propagate those changes back to the
build stage.

Every release should have its unique identification associated, such as a
timestamp, and each release is an increment of the previous version. This
implies that any modification must generate a new release.

The build process is initiated by developers when the code is pushed to an
environment. In contrast, runtime execution can occur automatically, such as
during a server reboot. Consequently, it's crucial to keep the run stage with as
few moving parts as possible, as issues at this stage might prevent the app from
running, especially during off-hours when support might not be readily
available. The build stage can be more complex, as developers actively manage
the deployment, keeping errors in the foreground.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
