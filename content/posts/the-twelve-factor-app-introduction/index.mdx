The Twelve-Factor app aims to provide the following benefits to your modern application:

- A well-organized or **declarative** setup automation that aims to simplify the
onboarding process for new developers joining the project and reduce the time
and costs associated with that task;
- Provides a **clean contract** with the operating system, **maximizing portability**
between execution environments;
- Aims to facilitate easy **deployment** on modern **cloud platforms**, eliminating the
need for servers and system administration;
- **Minimizes discrepancies between environments**, ensuring all environments have
the latest features up and running, enabling **continuous deployment** for maximum agility;
- Enables **scaling up** without requiring major changes, such as altering architecture,
tooling, or development practices.

This can be implemented in apps written in any programming language and utilizing
any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory, cache, etc).

The document leverages developers' experiences and observations regarding the
wide variety of software-as-a-service available in the industry.
The document was created by developers who have been involved in the development,
deployment, operation, and scaling of hundreds of apps through their work on the
Heroku platform. It focuses on ideal practices for app development, particularly
emphasizing the organic growth of an app over time, fostering collaboration
dynamics among developers working on the codebase, and avoiding the costs
associated with software erosion.

The motivation behind this document was to raise awareness of systemic problems
encountered in modern application development, establish a shared vocabulary for
discussing these issues, and offer solutions to address these challenges.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate the knowledge
I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit
