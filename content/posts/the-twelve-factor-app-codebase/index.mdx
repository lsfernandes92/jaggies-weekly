### One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

---

A codebase refers to the main code definition that serves as shared code among
developers for ongoing feature development. Typically, a codebase is stored in a
code repository managed by a version control system like `Git`, `Mercurial`,
or `Subversion`.

The codebase is a single repository or any set of repositories that share a root
commit.

There exists a one-to-one correlation between the codebase and the app:

* If there are multiple codebases, it does not qualify as a single codebase but
rather constitutes a distributed system. Each component in a distributed system
is considered an app, and each can individually adhere to the
Twelve-Factor principles.
* Having multiple apps sharing the same codebase violates the Twelve-Factor approach.
The recommended solution is to modularize shared code into libraries that can be
included through the dependency manager.

Per app, there exists only one codebase, but numerous deployments of the app can
exist. A deployment refers to a running instance of the app, which commonly
includes instances in production, staging, testing, and an additional local
instance for each developer.

While the codebase remains consistent across all these environments, there might
be different active versions in each environment due to ongoing feature
development during the development cycle.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate the knowledge
I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
