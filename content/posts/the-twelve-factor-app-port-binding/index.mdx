### Export services via port binding

---

At times, the server functions as a web server container where the web app
operates as a module within the container. For instance, a PHP app might run as
a module inside Apache HTTPD, or Java apps might function within Tomcat.

**The twelve-factor app is entirely self-contained** and doesn't depend on the
runtime injection of a web server into the execution environment to establish a
web-facing server. Instead, **the web app exports HTTP as a service by binding
to a port**, which serves as a listening port for incoming requests. In a local
environment, developers access the app by visiting `http://localhost:3000`.
In a deployment environment, a routing layer manages the routing of requests
from a public-facing hostname to the port-bound web processes.

This is commonly achieved by using dependency declarations to incorporate the
web server library into the app, such as using `Thin` for `Ruby`.

Furthermore, this approach signifies that any service can be exported by port
binding, awaiting incoming requests. It's important to note that by doing so,
one app can serve as the backing service for another app.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
