### Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

---

Historically, significant disparities have existed between development and
production environments, manifesting in several ways:

- The Time Gap: Code often takes days, weeks, or even months to reach
production, whereas it should ideally be deployed within hours or minutes.
- The Personnel Gap: Developers create code while DevOps engineers handle
deployment. Ideally, developers would be closely engaged in deploying and
observing its behavior in the production environment.
- The Tools Gap: Local development setups might utilize stacks like `Nginx`,
`SQLite`, and OS X, while production environments employ `Apache`, `MySQL`, and
Linux. Let's keep development and production as similar as possible.

**The Twelve-Factor app is engineered for continuous deployment, aiming to
narrow the gap between these environments.**

Developers adhering to **the twelve-factor principles resist the temptation to
use different backing services in development versus production.** This stems
from the appeal developers find in using lightweight services locally versus
more robust ones in production. Discrepancies between these services often lead
to minor incompatibilities, causing code that passed testing in dev or staging
to fail in production. This discourages continuous deployment and results in
considerable friction that incurs significant costs throughout an application's
lifecycle. Additionally, modern packaging systems like `Homebrew` and `apt-get`
have made installing and running modern backing services less challenging.

Many programming languages offer libraries that streamline access to backing
services, providing adapters for various service types. For instance,
`ActiveRecord` for `Ruby/Rails` includes database adapters such as `MySQL`,
`PostgreSQL`, and `SQLite`. While adapters to different backing services
simplify porting to new services, it's essential for all deployments (developer
environments, staging, production) to use the same type and version of each
backing service.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit
