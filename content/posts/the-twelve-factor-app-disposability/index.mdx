### Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

---

**The Twelve-Factor app's processes are designed to be disposable, allowing them
to be started or stopped at any moment.** This flexibility accelerates elastic
scaling, rapid deployment of code or configuration changes, and ensures the
resilience of production deployments.

Efforts should be made to **minimize the startup time of processes.** Swift
startups provide greater agility for the release process and scaling up,
contributing to robustness as the process manager can easily transfer processes
to new physical machines when needed.

**Processes shut down gracefully when they receive a `SIGTERM`** signal from the
process manager. In the case of a web process, this entails ceasing to listen on
the service port (rejecting new requests), allowing ongoing requests to be completed,
and then exiting. For instance, in the case of a worker process, graceful shutdown
involves returning the current job to the work queue. In `RabbitMQ`, a worker
can send a NACK to accomplish this.

Processes should also be resilient against abrupt termination, which could result
from hardware failures. Although less common than graceful shutdowns with SIGTERM,
such incidents can occur. An advisable strategy involves utilizing a robust
queueing backend like Beanstalkd, which returns jobs to the queue upon client
disconnection or timeouts. In any scenario, a twelve-factor app is structured
to handle unexpected, non graceful terminations. The crash-only design embodies
this principle to its logical conclusion.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
