### Treat backing services as attached resources

---

Backing services are classified as any resources required by the app to fulfill
its functionalities. Typically accessed via a network or other locations stored
within the configuration. These services include databases, SMTP clients,
third-party integrations such as `Amazon S3`, `Twitter`, or `Last.fm` APIs,
and caching systems. These backing services are usually managed by the
individual responsible for deploying the app and its resources.

**The Twelve-factor app doesn't differentiate between local and third-party
services.** For the app, both types of resources are accessed via URLs. Thus,
swapping out a local resource, like a database, for one managed by a third party
requires no code changes.

Resources can be attached to or detached from deployments at will. For instance,
if a database malfunctions, the app's administrator might spin up a new database
backup, detach the current database, and then restore the new database instance
by requiring no code alterations.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
