### Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

---

Besides the app's regular business processes, developers frequently need to
perform one-off administrative or maintenance tasks for the app, such as:

- Running database migrations;
- Running a console to run arbitrary code or inspect the app's model against the
live database;
- Running one-time scripts committed into the app's repo
(e.g. `php scripts/fix_bad_records.php`)

Those tasks should operate within the same environment as the regular
long-running processes of the app. They execute against a release, utilizing the
identical codebase and configuration. Moreover, to prevent synchronization
issues, the code must be shipped alongside the application code.

All process types should employ the same dependency isolation techniques. For
instance, if the Ruby web process utilizes the command `bundle exec thin start`,
the database migration should also use `bundle exec rails db:migrate`.

The Twelve-Factor app strongly advocates for languages that offer a built-in
REPL shell, simplifying the execution of one-off administrative scripts. During
development, developers can run these scripts by accessing a local console
within the app's container. In a production deployment, developers can access
the app's console via `SSH` or another mechanism provided by the execution
environment, and then execute the script.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
