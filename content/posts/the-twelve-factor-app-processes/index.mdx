### Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

---

The app operates within the execution environment as one or more processes.

Consider the code as a stand-alone script, the execution environment as the
developer's local machine with the installed language runtime, and the process
launched via the command line, for example, `$ ruby my_file.rb`.

**The Twelve-factor app dictates that processes should be stateless and share
nothing.** Any additional data requiring persistence must be stored in a backing
service, typically a database.

However, the memory space or filesystem of the process can be utilized as a
brief, single-transaction cache. For instance, downloading a large file,
performing operations on it, and then storing the results of the operation in
the database. Nonetheless, the Twelve-Factor app never assumes that anything
cached in memory or on disk will be available for future requests or jobs, as
future requests might be served by different processes.

Moreover, any language-specific packaging that utilizes the filesystem as a
cache for compiled assets violates the Twelve Factor app. It is preferred to
handle this during compilation in the build stage. _Tip: The Rails asset
pipeline can be configured to package assets during the build stage._

Certain web systems rely on "sticky sessions" where user session data is
cached in the memory of the appâ€™s process, expecting subsequent requests from
the same visitor to be routed to the same process. This practice also violates
the Twelve-Factor app. Session state data is better suited for a datastore
offering time expiration, such as Memcached or Redis.

_This Twelve-Factor App post series is a means for me to consolidate
the knowledge I've gained while studying these rules. Please feel free to visit

That's all folks!_
